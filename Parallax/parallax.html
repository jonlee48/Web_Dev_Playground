          Parallax (from Ancient Greek, parallaxis, meaning 'alternation') is a
          displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed
          along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or
          semi-angle of inclination between those two lines.[1][2] Due to
          foreshortening, nearby objects show a larger parallax than farther
          objects when observed from different positions, so parallax can be used
          to determine distances.

          To measure large distances, such as the distance of a planet or a star
          from Earth, astronomers use the principle of parallax. Here, the term
          parallax is the semi-angle of inclination between two sight-lines to
          the star, as observed when Earth is on opposite sides of the Sun in
          its orbit.[3] These distances form the lowest rung of what is called
          "the cosmic distance ladder", the first in a succession of methods by
          which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects,
          serving as a basis for other distance measurements in astronomy
          forming the higher rungs of the ladder.
